# Bayesian Machine Learning
 Bayesian Machine Learning project in which PyMC was deployed to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling methods to fit models including; Bayesian Logistic Regression,  										Principle Components Analysis, Hidden Markov Models, and Markov Graphical Models. Using Bayesian methods may make models more robust 										by introducing probability and adressing uncertainty in model predictions.
